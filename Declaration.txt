

The architecture using Convolutional Neural Networks for handwritten digit and operator recognition for an expression of two one-digit numbers and an operator, 
along with the positional prediction for operator (i.e. infix/prefix/postfix) has been solely developed by the Team AIMLC_HackTheSummer, 
comprising of Aadarsh Gupta (EE, IIT-Delhi), Kuldeep Meena (CSE, IIT Delhi) and Vishal Saini(EE, IIT Delhi) for the purpose of submission to problem statement for
Hack The Summer by AIMLC, IIT Delhi.
