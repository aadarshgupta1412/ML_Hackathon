# Handwritten expression evaluator

AUTHORS: Vishal Saini,Kuldeep Meena,Aadarsh Gupta

The software aims to classify handwritten expressions into prefix, postfix, infix categories and finally evaluating the expression to produce desired value.The basic idea is to divide each image into 3 parts and classify each part to its corresponding meaning i.e a number 1 to 9 for an image with a number and +, - , * , / for the corresponding operators.
